### How to specify format manually

Most backends don't support manually specifying media format, with Android and Web being the exceptions. Therefore, there's no formal API planned for this feature. However, supported platforms can automatically detect the format from the URL. You can simply append a file extension to the query string or hash fragment to specify the format. Please note that only 3 extensions are recognized: `.m3u8`, `.mpd`, and `.ism/manifest`. If multiple extensions are found, the last one takes precedence. For example:
```dart
// No need to specify format, the url already contains `.m3u8`
final example0 = 'https://example.com/video.m3u8';

// Missing extension in path, add `.m3u8` in hash fragment
final example1 = 'https://example.com/video#.m3u8';

// Or in query string
final example1 = 'https://example.com/video?.m3u8';

// Override HLS to DASH
final example2 = 'https://example.com/video.m3u8#.mpd';
```

[^subtitle]: Only internal subtitle tracks are supported.
[^mediaplayer]: `MediaPlayer` may lead to crash on certain Windows builds when rendering subtitles.
[^mpv]: `video_view` requires `mpv`(v0.4+) or `libmpv`(aka `mpv-libs`) on Linux. Developers integrating this plugin into Linux app should install `libmpv-dev`(aka `mpv-libs-devel`) instead. If unavailable in your package manager, please build `mpv` from source. For details refer to [mpv-build](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build).
[^shaka]: `video_view` requires [ShakaPlayer](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/shaka-player/dist/shaka-player.compiled.js) v4.15+ to enable HLS, DASH, MSS support on web platforms.
[^h265]: Windows user may need to install a free [H.265 decoder](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n4wgh0z6vhq) from Microsoft Store. Web platforms may lack H.265 support except for Apple webkit.
[^apple]: Apple platforms may lack WebM and AV1 support.
[^vtt]: WebVTT subtitles within HLS are not supported by Linux backend.
[^avplayer]: DASH and MSS are not supported by iOS/macOS backend.
